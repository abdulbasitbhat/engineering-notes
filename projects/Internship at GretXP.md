## Overview

During my final year, I undertook a **Full Stack Development Internship at GretXP**, a company focused on creating **immersive VR experiences for the web**. This internship played a crucial role in shaping my understanding of **modern software development**, both technically and professionally.

GretXP’s core product, **BuildVR**, is a no-code VR website builder that enables businesses and creators to integrate **interactive 3D experiences** into their websites with ease. Being part of the BuildVR team gave me hands-on exposure to building scalable, production-grade software used by real users.

---

## Background

**BuildVR by GretXP** is a web and 3D asset creation platform that allows users to build websites strip-by-strip without writing code. The platform supports:

- Website essentials like navigation bars, text sections, buttons, and links  
- Image and video integrations  
- Immersive 3D experiences powered by **Three.js**  
- A seamless, engagement-focused interface  

The internship was designed to bridge **academic learning and industry practices**, emphasizing real-world problem-solving, system thinking, and collaboration.

---

## Scope of Work

My responsibilities spanned across multiple domains, including:

- Feature development  
- UI / UX design and optimization  
- API development and integration  
- Generative AI feature implementation  
- SEO optimization  
- Subscription management  
- System optimization and scalability  
- Maintenance and bug fixing  
- Technology migrations  

This wide scope helped me understand how different layers of a product evolve together.

---

## Project Overview

Throughout the internship, my work followed a structured learning and execution path:

1. Understanding system architecture  
2. Exploring the existing codebase and workflows  
3. Learning best practices used in production systems  
4. Working under guidance and gradually taking ownership  
5. Researching, deciding, implementing, and testing features independently  

This progression helped me transition from guided learning to **responsible ownership of features**.

## Technologies & Tools

While working at GretXP, I used and learned across multiple areas of the stack, including:

- **Frontend:** React.js, UI frameworks  
- **Backend:** API development and system design  
- **3D & Immersive Tech:** Three.js  
- **Generative AI:** OpenAI APIs (GPT models, DALL·E)  
- **SEO & Performance Optimization**  
- **Source Control:** Git-based workflows  
- **Testing & Validation:** Postman and test environments  

---

## Technical Learnings

### UI / UX Design & Implementation
Designed and implemented UI components based on product requirements using React.js, focusing on usability, consistency, and performance.

### API Development
Designed, implemented, optimized, and tested APIs. Integrated third-party APIs and ensured smooth communication between system components.

### Generative AI Integration
Integrated OpenAI APIs to enable:
- Automatic text generation  
- Image generation  
- Code and content assistance  

These features enhanced user productivity and platform capabilities.

### SEO Optimization
Worked on improving crawler indexing, page performance, and SEO-related optimizations to improve visibility and speed.

### System Design
Gained exposure to the architecture of complex systems and best practices followed in modern, scalable applications.

### Development Lifecycle
Experienced the complete lifecycle of feature development — from requirement justification and research to trade-offs, implementation, and testing.

---

## Professional Learnings

### Value-Oriented Development
Learned to evaluate features based on **value vs. resource cost**, making informed trade-offs rather than purely technical decisions.

### Presentation & Communication
Regularly presented work, proposals, and ideas in an engaging and structured manner to mentors and team members.

### Time Management
Managed time, energy, and priorities to ensure high-quality output while meeting deadlines.

### Decision Making
Developed a broader perspective on development workflows and practiced calculated, data-informed decisions.

## Insights into Modern Software Development

- Modern software heavily relies on **third-party services** to accelerate development and increase value  
- **Agile and Scrum methodologies** enable parallel development and faster iteration  
- Source control systems are essential for collaboration and clean workflows  
- Security and scalability are first-class concerns in production software  
- Test environments are critical, as features often behave differently in production than on localhost  

---

## Key Highlights

- Adoption of Agile and Scrum workflows  
- Strong focus on security and scalability  
- Independent development of complete feature workflows  
- Creation and testing of **20+ APIs**  
- Emphasis on clean, readable, and explainable code  
- Continuous learning through documentation and market research  

---

## Reflection

This internship marked a significant shift in how I view software development. Beyond writing code, I learned how **real products are built, scaled, secured, and maintained**. It reinforced the importance of clean code, collaboration, documentation, and long-term thinking.

The experience strengthened my confidence in working on complex systems and prepared me for professional software development environments.
