### 🎓 Final Year Capstone Project — Team Lead  
**Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala**

During my final year, I had the opportunity to serve as the **Team Lead** for our Capstone Project. This experience allowed me to take on formal leadership responsibility while working on a technically challenging and high-impact project.

The project was crucial for me as it strengthened not only my **technical skills**, but also my **leadership, coordination, and decision-making abilities**. Through consistent planning, collaboration, and hard work, our team delivered one of the **smoothest project assessments** we had envisioned.

The **project idea itself was acknowledged as a strong achievement** by the assessment panel, both for its relevance and execution.
