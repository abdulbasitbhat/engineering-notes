### 🌐 Exploring Language-Agnostic Development — .NET & Vue.js Project

After being trained as a **Java Full Stack Engineer at Accenture**, I became curious to test whether I could translate my learnings across **different programming languages and frameworks**.

Coming from a **React and Django background**, and having recently worked with **Java Full Stack technologies** (Spring, JSP, Spring Boot), I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could truly become **language-agnostic**. This curiosity took me back to my college days, when I relied heavily on documentation to learn Django from scratch.

While browsing through ideas, I felt a strong urge to build something using **.NET and Vue.js**—a stack I had never worked with before. The idea evolved into a platform aimed at helping **tourists explore Kashmir and its landscapes**, ensuring they don’t miss out on key experiences. This need became especially evident after meeting a few South Indian travelers in Hyderabad who had limited knowledge about the region.

I decided to go all in and build the platform **purely by leveraging official documentation**. Over time, the project expanded to include:
- A **blogging system**
- A **digital souvenir system** featuring unique collectibles
- Complete **user account management**

While working on this project, I realized how familiar many **.NET concepts** felt—such as:
- C#’s similarity to Java
- Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control
- Object-Relational Mapping
- Layered architecture (Controller, Service, DAO)

On the frontend, **Vue.js** initially felt quite different from React, which made the learning curve steeper. However, with time, it became an enjoyable experience, and I successfully built a **fully responsive, modular, and maintainable application**.
